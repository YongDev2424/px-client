# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an advanced state management system for the PixiJS C4 Editor that supports hierarchical node structures, multi-level zoom capabilities, dynamic properties, and comprehensive JSON serialization. The system will enable users to create complex C4 diagrams with nested components, drill-down navigation similar to C4 levels or IcePanel, and rich metadata management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Node and Edge Selection with Toolbar Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see edit and delete buttons in the toolbar when I select a node or edge, so that I can quickly access common operations for both nodes and edges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is selected THEN the system SHALL display edit and delete icons in the toolbar
2. WHEN an edge is selected THEN the system SHALL display edit and delete icons in the toolbar
3. WHEN the edit button is clicked THEN the system SHALL enter edit mode for the selected node or edge
4. WHEN the delete button is clicked THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation and delete the selected node or edge if confirmed
5. WHEN no node or edge is selected THEN the system SHALL hide the edit and delete buttons from the toolbar
6. WHEN multiple nodes or edges are selected THEN the system SHALL hide the edit and delete buttons from the toolbar
7. WHEN both nodes and edges are selected simultaneously THEN the system SHALL hide the edit and delete buttons from the toolbar


### Requirement 2: Multi-Property System for Nodes and Edges

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple custom properties to nodes and edges, so that I can store rich metadata and documentation within my diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses node properties THEN the system SHALL allow adding unlimited custom properties
2. WHEN a user accesses edge properties THEN the system SHALL allow adding unlimited custom properties
3. WHEN adding a property THEN the system SHALL support text, number, and boolean property types
4. WHEN a property is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier and maintain display order
5. WHEN properties are modified THEN the system SHALL validate data types and prevent duplicate keys
6. WHEN properties are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove them from both state and JSON representation

### Requirement 3: Multi-Label System for Nodes and Edges

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple labels to nodes and edges with different styles and positions, so that I can provide comprehensive labeling and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds labels to a node THEN the system SHALL support multiple labels with independent positioning
2. WHEN a user adds labels to an edge THEN the system SHALL support multiple labels along the edge path
3. WHEN editing labels THEN the system SHALL provide in-place editing for each label independently
4. WHEN labels are created THEN the system SHALL assign unique identifiers and support different text styles
5. WHEN labels overlap THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and positioning assistance
6. WHEN labels are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove them from both visual display and data model

### Requirement 4: Property and Label Editing Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit properties and labels through an intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently manage node and edge metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user double-clicks a property THEN the system SHALL enter inline editing mode
2. WHEN a user double-clicks a label THEN the system SHALL enter inline text editing mode
3. WHEN editing properties THEN the system SHALL provide type-appropriate input controls (text field, number input, checkbox)
4. WHEN editing is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the editing area and provide save/cancel options
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and prevent invalid data entry
6. WHEN editing is completed THEN the system SHALL update both visual display and underlying data model

### Requirement 5: Hierarchical Node System with Multi-Level Zoom

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create nested node structures with zoom-in capabilities similar to C4 levels, so that I can represent complex system architectures with appropriate levels of detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node contains sub-nodes THEN the system SHALL display a zoom icon in the top-left corner
2. WHEN the zoom icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL zoom into the node showing its internal structure
3. WHEN zooming in THEN the system SHALL use recompose-layers and diff/patch techniques for smooth transitions
4. WHEN at a deeper level THEN the system SHALL provide zoom-out capability to return to parent levels
5. WHEN zooming THEN the system SHALL maintain a breadcrumb trail showing current navigation path
6. WHEN at maximum zoom depth THEN the system SHALL disable further zoom-in capabilities

### Requirement 6: Sub-Node Management and Cross-Level Connections

**User Story:** As a user, I want sub-nodes to connect with other parent-level nodes, so that I can represent complex system interactions across different architectural levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating connections from sub-nodes THEN the system SHALL allow connections to parent-level nodes
2. WHEN a sub-node connects to a parent node THEN the system SHALL maintain connection integrity across zoom levels
3. WHEN zooming out THEN the system SHALL aggregate sub-node connections appropriately
4. WHEN connections span levels THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators of cross-level relationships
5. WHEN moving nodes THEN the system SHALL update all related cross-level connections automatically

### Requirement 7: Level-Based Edge and Node Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see only the nodes and edges relevant to my current zoom level, so that I can focus on the appropriate level of architectural detail without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Level 1 THEN the system SHALL hide all Level 2 and Level 3 nodes and edges
2. WHEN viewing Level 2 THEN the system SHALL hide Level 3 nodes and edges but show Level 1 context
3. WHEN viewing Level 3 THEN the system SHALL show full detail while maintaining parent context
4. WHEN switching levels THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly using diff/patch algorithms
5. WHEN edges span multiple levels THEN the system SHALL show appropriate connection representations at each level

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive JSON Serialization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to export complete project data as JSON, so that I can save, load, and share my diagrams with all their metadata and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting project data THEN the system SHALL serialize all nodes with their properties, labels, and hierarchy
2. WHEN exporting project data THEN the system SHALL serialize all edges with their properties, labels, and connections
3. WHEN exporting project data THEN the system SHALL include zoom level information and current view state
4. WHEN importing project data THEN the system SHALL restore complete diagram state including all metadata
5. WHEN serializing THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between nodes and edges
6. WHEN deserializing THEN the system SHALL validate data structure and handle migration of older formats

### Requirement 9: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to efficiently manage memory and rendering performance, so that complex diagrams with many levels remain responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing large hierarchies THEN the system SHALL implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
2. WHEN zooming between levels THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading for off-screen content
3. WHEN rendering THEN the system SHALL implement viewport culling to avoid rendering invisible elements
4. WHEN updating state THEN the system SHALL use efficient diff algorithms to minimize re-renders
5. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection for unused node states

### Requirement 10: State Synchronization and Event System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust event system that keeps all UI components synchronized, so that changes in one part of the system are reflected everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN node state changes THEN the system SHALL dispatch appropriate events to all listening components
2. WHEN properties are modified THEN the system SHALL update both visual representation and data model atomically
3. WHEN zoom level changes THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant components to update their display
4. WHEN connections are created or modified THEN the system SHALL update all affected nodes and edges
5. WHEN state conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using a defined precedence system
