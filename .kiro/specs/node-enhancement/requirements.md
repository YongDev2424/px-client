# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the C4 diagram nodes with advanced interaction capabilities including collapsible/expandable states, contextual action buttons, and dynamic property management. The enhancement will provide users with more sophisticated control over node presentation and data management while maintaining the intuitive drag-and-drop workflow of the existing C4 editor.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Node Collapse/Expand Functionality

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want to collapse and expand nodes to manage visual complexity and focus on specific parts of my architecture diagram, so that I can create cleaner and more organized diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is created THEN the system SHALL display the node in expanded state by default
2. WHEN a user clicks on a collapse/expand indicator on a node THEN the system SHALL toggle between collapsed and expanded states
3. WHEN a node is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show only the node title and type with a compact visual representation
4. WHEN a node is expanded THEN the system SHALL show the full node content including all properties and descriptions
5. WHEN a node state changes THEN the system SHALL animate the transition smoothly over 300ms
6. WHEN a node is collapsed THEN the system SHALL maintain all connection points for edges
7. WHEN a node is collapsed THEN the system SHALL resize the node to fit the minimal content while preserving readability

### Requirement 2: Contextual Action Buttons

**User Story:** As a diagram editor, I want to see edit and delete buttons when I select a node, so that I can quickly access common node operations without navigating through menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is selected THEN the system SHALL display edit and delete action buttons near the selected node
2. WHEN a node is deselected THEN the system SHALL hide the action buttons immediately
3. WHEN the edit button is clicked THEN the system SHALL enter edit mode for the selected node
4. WHEN the delete button is clicked THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
5. WHEN delete is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove the node and all connected edges
6. WHEN multiple nodes are selected THEN the system SHALL show action buttons only for the primary selected node
7. WHEN action buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL not interfere with node dragging or edge creation
8. WHEN action buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned consistently relative to the node bounds

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Property Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to add, edit, and remove custom properties on nodes, so that I can capture detailed metadata and specifications for each component in my architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is in edit mode THEN the system SHALL display a property management interface
2. WHEN the add property button is clicked THEN the system SHALL create a new empty property field
3. WHEN a property key is entered THEN the system SHALL validate that the key is unique within the node
4. WHEN a property value is entered THEN the system SHALL accept text, numbers, and basic formatting
5. WHEN a property is saved THEN the system SHALL display it in the node's expanded view
6. WHEN a property delete button is clicked THEN the system SHALL remove the property after confirmation
7. WHEN properties are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust node size to accommodate content
8. WHEN a node has properties THEN the system SHALL display a property count indicator in collapsed view
9. WHEN properties exceed display space THEN the system SHALL implement scrolling or pagination within the node
10. WHEN a node is saved THEN the system SHALL persist all properties with the node data
11. WHEN a property key is duplicated THEN the system SHALL show an error message and prevent saving
12. WHEN property editing is cancelled THEN the system SHALL revert to the previous property state

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Node Visual States

**User Story:** As a diagram viewer, I want clear visual indicators for different node states and interactions, so that I can easily understand the current state and available actions for each node.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is collapsed THEN the system SHALL display a distinct visual style with collapse indicator
2. WHEN a node is expanded THEN the system SHALL display a distinct visual style with expand indicator
3. WHEN a node is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the node with selection styling
4. WHEN a node has properties THEN the system SHALL show a property indicator badge
5. WHEN a node is in edit mode THEN the system SHALL apply edit mode styling to distinguish from view mode
6. WHEN hovering over action buttons THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with hover states
7. WHEN a node state transition occurs THEN the system SHALL use consistent animation timing and easing
8. WHEN nodes have different states THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and readability

### Requirement 5: Keyboard and Accessibility Support

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to interact with enhanced node features using keyboard navigation and screen readers, so that I can effectively use the diagram editor regardless of my input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is focused THEN the system SHALL allow keyboard navigation to action buttons using Tab key
2. WHEN Enter key is pressed on a focused node THEN the system SHALL toggle collapse/expand state
3. WHEN Delete key is pressed on a selected node THEN the system SHALL trigger delete confirmation
4. WHEN Escape key is pressed during edit mode THEN the system SHALL cancel editing and revert changes
5. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce node state changes and available actions
6. WHEN keyboard navigating THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
7. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL not conflict with existing application shortcuts
