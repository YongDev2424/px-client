# Requirements Document

## ⚠️ Important Note for PixiJS Development
**Before working on any requirements involving PixiJS integration, please read `.claude/pixijs-v8-patterns.md` for proper API usage patterns and syntax. This project uses PixiJS v8 which has different syntax from earlier versions.**

## Introduction

ฟีเจอร์ Dashboard Layout Management จะจัดการการแบ่งพื้นที่หน้าจอเป็นสัดส่วนที่เหมาะสมสำหรับการทำงานกับ C4 diagram โดยแบ่งเป็น 3 ส่วนหลัก: Left Panel สำหรับแสดงรายการ C4 components แบบ hierarchical, Toolbar สำหรับเครื่องมือจัดการ และ Canvas สำหรับแสดงและแก้ไข diagram พร้อมระบบ zoom และ grid background

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want a left panel showing C4 model components in a hierarchical structure, so that I can easily navigate and organize my diagram elements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application loads THEN system SHALL display a left panel occupying 20% of screen width
2. WHEN displaying C4 components THEN system SHALL organize them in hierarchical tree structure with C4 Level 1 as parent folders
3. WHEN showing hierarchy THEN system SHALL display C4 Level 2-4 as subfolders under their respective Level 1 parents
4. WHEN user clicks on a folder THEN system SHALL expand/collapse to show/hide child components
5. WHEN user clicks on a component THEN system SHALL highlight corresponding element on canvas
6. WHEN components are connected THEN system SHALL show visual indicators of relationships in the tree
7. IF no components exist THEN system SHALL show empty state message in the panel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want to hide/show the left panel, so that I can maximize canvas space when needed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application loads THEN system SHALL display a toggle button to hide/show left panel
2. WHEN user clicks hide button THEN system SHALL collapse left panel and expand canvas to full width
3. WHEN panel is hidden THEN system SHALL show a small expand button on the left edge
4. WHEN user clicks expand button THEN system SHALL restore left panel to 20% width and adjust canvas accordingly
5. WHEN panel state changes THEN system SHALL animate the transition smoothly over 300ms
6. WHEN panel is hidden THEN system SHALL remember the state for the current session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want a toolbar in the right area for managing nodes and edges, so that I can access editing tools efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application loads THEN system SHALL display toolbar at the top of right area occupying maximum 5% of right area height
2. WHEN displaying toolbar THEN system SHALL include buttons for adding different C4 component types
3. WHEN displaying toolbar THEN system SHALL include buttons for edge creation and management tools
4. WHEN user hovers over toolbar buttons THEN system SHALL show tooltips explaining each tool's function
5. WHEN toolbar buttons are clicked THEN system SHALL activate corresponding tool mode
6. WHEN tool is active THEN system SHALL provide visual feedback showing current active tool

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want a canvas area with grid background for creating diagrams, so that I can align elements precisely

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application loads THEN system SHALL display canvas occupying remaining space after left panel and toolbar
2. WHEN displaying canvas THEN system SHALL show grid background pattern for alignment guidance
3. WHEN canvas is active THEN system SHALL allow drag and drop operations for creating and moving elements
4. WHEN elements are placed THEN system SHALL provide snap-to-grid functionality for precise alignment
5. WHEN canvas is empty THEN system SHALL show subtle instructions for getting started
6. WHEN canvas contains elements THEN system SHALL maintain proper layering with edges behind nodes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want zoom controls at the bottom-right corner, so that I can adjust the view scale of my diagram

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application loads THEN system SHALL display zoom controls at bottom-right corner of canvas
2. WHEN displaying zoom controls THEN system SHALL include zoom in, zoom out, and reset to 100% buttons
3. WHEN user clicks zoom in THEN system SHALL increase canvas scale by 25% increments up to 400%
4. WHEN user clicks zoom out THEN system SHALL decrease canvas scale by 25% increments down to 25%
5. WHEN user clicks reset THEN system SHALL restore canvas to 100% scale and center the view
6. WHEN zoom level changes THEN system SHALL display current zoom percentage
7. WHEN using mouse wheel on canvas THEN system SHALL zoom in/out at cursor position

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want Node and Edge designs that match the uploaded reference image, so that my diagrams have consistent professional appearance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying C4 nodes THEN system SHALL use rounded rectangle shapes with appropriate shadows and borders as shown in reference image
2. WHEN showing different C4 levels THEN system SHALL use distinct colors and styling: Level 1 (blue tones), Level 2 (green tones), Level 3 (orange tones), Level 4 (gray tones)
3. WHEN displaying edges THEN system SHALL use clean lines with proper arrow heads and label backgrounds matching reference design
4. WHEN nodes contain text THEN system SHALL use appropriate font sizes, weights, and colors for optimal readability
5. WHEN showing node icons THEN system SHALL include relevant symbols (person, system, container, component) as per C4 model standards
6. WHEN elements are in different states THEN system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover, selected, connected) consistent with reference design

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want layout areas that never overlap or interfere with each other, so that I have a stable and predictable workspace

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN left panel is visible THEN system SHALL ensure canvas area starts exactly where panel ends with no overlap
2. WHEN left panel is collapsed THEN system SHALL smoothly expand canvas to use full available width without content jumping
3. WHEN toolbar is displayed THEN system SHALL ensure canvas area starts below toolbar with proper spacing
4. WHEN zoom controls are shown THEN system SHALL position them within canvas bounds without covering diagram content
5. WHEN resizing browser window THEN system SHALL maintain proportional layout without element overlap
6. WHEN panel transitions occur THEN system SHALL animate layout changes smoothly to prevent jarring visual shifts
7. IF screen size is too small THEN system SHALL gracefully adapt layout or show minimum size warning

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want the UI design to follow UX/UI best practices and Laws of UX, so that the interface is intuitive and accessible

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing color scheme THEN system SHALL ensure minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text readability (WCAG AA compliance)
2. WHEN applying Fitts' Law THEN system SHALL make frequently used buttons larger and position them closer to user's typical cursor position
3. WHEN implementing Hick's Law THEN system SHALL limit toolbar options to essential tools and group related functions
4. WHEN following Miller's Rule THEN system SHALL limit hierarchical tree depth to 7±2 levels for cognitive load management
5. WHEN applying Gestalt Principles THEN system SHALL group related UI elements using proximity, similarity, and closure
6. WHEN designing interactions THEN system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms for all user actions
7. WHEN using colors THEN system SHALL maintain consistent color semantics (blue for primary actions, red for destructive actions)
8. WHEN designing spacing THEN system SHALL use consistent 8px grid system for all margins, padding, and element positioning
